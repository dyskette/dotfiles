Endless work in progress, writing while reading the manuals and docs. Taking other configurations as reference and mixing what I think is best for my needs.

## Zsh
Great shell. I'm not gonna lie, what I liked first about this software was the autocompletion. But it has a great number of other features ready to configure.

## Vim
What can I say about THE text editor that hasn't been said. When I started to panic about carpal tunnel I switched to vim, and voila, problem solved. Of course, it needs some tweaking.

## MPV
Sometimes you just need a good video player.

I watch a lot of Japanese and Korean stuff, I speak Spanish and broken English. The config file has those languages configured. Using DejaVu Fonts, because that font is love.

## GIMP
Quick fix for fonts having mixes of colors inside. What it does is deactivate subpixel rendering.

## Fontconfig
Only fontconfig without adding stuff like infinality. It needs Microsoft Windows fonts for language support. Although they can be replaced with free fonts.

Other fonts, liberation, dejavu, droid and cantarell.
