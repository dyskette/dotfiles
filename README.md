This is still a work in progress, writing while reading the manuals and docs. Taking other configurations as reference and mixing what I think is best for my needs.

## Zsh
Great shell. I'm not gonna lie, what I liked first about this software was the autocompletion. But it has a great number of other features ready to configure.

## Vim
What can I say about THE text editor that hasn't been said. When I started to panic about carpal tunnel I switched to vim, and voila, problem solved. Of course, it needs some tweaking.

## MPV
Sometimes you just need a good video player.

I watch a lot of Japanese and Korean stuff, I speak Spanish and broken English. The config file has those languages configured. Using DejaVu Fonts, because that font is love.
